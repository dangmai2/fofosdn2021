						<p>There are several contemporary examples of network failures, particularly in the domain of
							SDNs, that led to substantial loss for businesses. Formal approaches have been proposed to
							provide a foundational approach to addressing such issues through correct-by-design
							construction, specification, and verification of SDN programs. Formal methods are promised
							to address performance, reliability, and security issues of SDNs using the rigour provided
							by their underlying mathematics. Hence, formal specification and verification of Network
							Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networks (SDN) have been gaining
							momentum in recent years. The focus of this workshop is on formal methods aimed to enable a
							formal specification and verification of SDNs and NFVs. The topics of interest include, but
							are not restricted to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>foundations (including formal semantics of) programming languages,</li>
							<li>formal specification languages,</li>
							<li>formal verification techniques,</li>
							<li>synthesis and correct-by-construction methods, and</li>
							<li>testing, debugging, monitoring and other forms of non-exhaustive validation and
								verification</li>

									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>Writing classification rules to identify interesting network traffic is a
										time-consuming and error-prone task. Learning-based classification systems
										automatically extract such rules from positive and negative traffic examples.
										However, due to limitations in the representation of network traffic and the
										learning strategy, these systems lack both expressiveness to cover a range of
										applications and interpretability in fully describing the traffic’s structure at
										the session layer. We describe Sharingan system, which uses program synthesis
										techniques to generate network classification programs at the session layer.
										Sharingan accepts raw network traces as inputs and reports potential patterns of
										the target traffic in NetQRE, a domain specific language designed for specifying
										session-layer quantitative properties. We develop a range of novel optimizations
										that reduce the synthesis time for large and complex tasks to a matter of
										minutes. Our experiments show that Sharingan is able to correctly identify
										patterns from a diverse set of network traces and generates explainable outputs,
										while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art learning-based systems.

									<p class="location"><b>Network-function Verification without Verification
											Expertise</b></p>
									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>Software middleboxes promise shorter development cycles and the flexibility to
										deploy network functionality on demand; but — like any piece of frequently
										updated software — they can suffer from bugs, unpredictable behavior, and
										security vulnerabilities. I will talk about Vigor, a software stack and
										toolchain for building software middleboxes that are guaranteed to be correct,
										while preserving competitive performance and developer productivity. Vigor has
										three key features: network-function developers need no verification expertise,
										and the verification process does not require their assistance (push-button
										verification); the entire software stack is verified, down to the hardware
										(full-stack verification); and verification can be done in a pay-as-you-go
										manner, i.e., instead of investing upfront a lot of time in writing and
										verifying a complete specification, one can specify one-off properties in a few
										lines of Python and verify them without concern for the rest. I will also
										discuss how we are evolving this approach to enable performance—not only
										semantic—verification.

									<p class="location"><b>Checking Dynamic Policies in Stateful Networks</b></p>
									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>The security, performance, and availability of our critical network
										infrastructures relies on the correct implementation of different policy goals.
										Network operators realize these goals by composing and configuring diverse
										stateful middleboxes such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and web
										proxies. Checking policy violations is hard even for simple reachability
										properties (e.g., can A talk to B) in today's networks. The stateful nature of
										processing in middleboxes and the dynamic context-dependent policies
										implemented using them introduces new concerns with respect to correctness. This
										talk will provide a brief overview of recent advances in the space of stateful
										network testing and verification, including: (1) application of program
										analysis techniques to automatically generate test cases; (2) principled
										approach to enable scalable parallel testing for stateful networks; (3) more
										systematic verification capabilities beyond testing; and (4) techniques to
										automatically synthesize such models from blackbox observations to aid these
										aforementioned tools.</p>

									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>We present Prognosis, a framework offering automated closed-box learning and
										analysis of models of network protocol implementations. Prognosis can learn
										models that vary in abstraction level from simple deterministic automata to
										models containing data operations, such as register updates, and can be used to
										unlock a variety of analysis techniques -- model checking temporal properties,
										computing differences between models of two implementations of the same
										protocol, or improving testing via model-based test generation. Prognosis is
										modular and easily adaptable to different protocols (e.g. TCP and QUIC) and
										their implementations. We use Prognosis to learn models of (parts of) three QUIC
										implementations -- Quiche (Cloudflare), Google QUIC, and Facebook mvfst -- and
										use these models to analyse the differences between the various implementations.
										Our analysis provides insights into different design choices and uncovers
										potential bugs. Concretely, we have found critical bugs in multiple QUIC
										implementations, which have been acknowledged by the developers. </p>

											Opportunities</b></p>
									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>A fundamental issue of network verification is scalability. This talk will
										present some of our recent results toward scaling network verification to large
										networks. For control plane, we made a new finding on the classic stable path
										problem, the foundation of many control plane verification tools. We also
										designed a privacy-preserving tool to verify control planes on an interdomain
										level. For data plane, we proposed a distributed design, which allows us to
										verify a wide range of properties at the scale of data center networks. Other
										than showcasing our progress, we also summarize some interesting research
										opportunities.</p>

									<p class="location"><b>NV: A Platform for Modelling and Verifying Network
											Configurations</b></p>
								
									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>Router configuration languages like those provided by CISCO, Juniper and other
										vendors are immensely complicated, with hundreds of commands and endless
										documentation. Building tools for analyzing such configurations directly is
										challenging and time consuming due to this complexity, especially when protocol
										transformations or abstractions are needed to improve analysis performance. In
										this talk, we will describe the design and implementation of NV, a functional
										language with a simple, small, orthogonal and compositional set of constructs
										that suffice to model the semantics and configuration of common network
										protocols. We have built several analysis tools for NV, including both compiled
										and interpreted mtBDD-based network simulators, an SMT-based verifier, and a
										network compression tool. Several of these tools outperform prior
										state-of-the-art tools in the same class thanks in part to the ease of applying
										a series of optimizing transformations over our intermediate language. We also
										have a translation tool that converts source-level configurations for a number
										of common protocols and configuration features into NV automatically.
										<br>
										This is joint work with Nick Giannarakis, Devon Loehr and Ryan Beckett.

									<p class="location"><b>Petr4: Formal Foundations for P4 Data Planes</b></p>
									
									<p class="location"><b>Abstract</b></p>
									<p>P4 is a domain-specific language for specifying the behavior of packet-processing
										systems. It is based on an elegant design with high-level abstractions, such as
										parsers and match action pipelines, which can be compiled to efficient
										implementations in hardware or software. Unfortunately, like many industrial
										languages, P4 lacks a formal foundation. The P4 specification is a 160-page
										document with a mixture of informal prose, graphical diagrams, and pseudocode.
										The reference compiler is complex, running to over 40KLoC of C++ code. Clearly
										neither of these artifacts is suitable for formal reasoning. This talk will
										introduce a new framework called Petr4 (pronounced "Petra"), that puts P4 on a
										solid foundation. Petr4 uses standard elements of the semantics engineering
										toolkit, namely type systems and operational semantics, to build a compositional
										semantics that assigns an unambiguous meaning to every P4 program. Petr4 is
										implemented as an OCaml prototype that has been validated against a suite of
										over 750 tests from the reference implementation. While developing Petr4, we
										discovered dozens of bugs in the language specification and the reference
										implementation, many of which have been fixed. Furthermore, we have used Petr4
										to establish the soundness of P4’s type system, prove key properties such as
										termination, and formalize a language extension.</p>

										the design and implementation of languages for programming software-defined
										networks. In the past he has also worked on bidirectional languages (also known
										as "lenses"), database query languages, data provenance, type systems,
										mechanized proof, and formal semantics. He received a PhD in Computer Science
